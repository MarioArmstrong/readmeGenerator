## Description

### User Story:

AS A user I WANT TO be able to generate a README.md file just by inputting information into the terminal SO THAT the generated README file is as professional as possible.

Simplicity is the main motivation for this README generator. Users do not need to know how to format a README or know the rules to Markdown language.

The user's problem of not knowing how to format a professional README is the main problem solved by this application.

I learned how to effectively format the layout of a README, and how to stylize text to produce a professional looking README file.

The simplicity and stream line coding is what makes this application stand out.

The main challenge that I faced when coding this application was trying to code everything on one page, but the code would not work in that manner. The improvements I would like to implement are more styling based, and coding the application so that the user can upload a screenshot image to the README when prompted to.
